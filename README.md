# Balls 2D
2D realtime simulation of ball collisions in a box with some additional features. Planned to be upgraded in free time.

### Project description
Small and quite old project of mine that consists of 2D simulation of balls bouncing in a box. Written in C++ and SFML.
In future, I'm planning to add additional game-like features to make this school project a playable game. Code is simple, yet flexible, so I can come back to it anytime.
